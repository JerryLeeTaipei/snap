# About alsa-utils

The alsa-utils snap provides a few very basic utilities to deal with the Linux
kernel ALSA audio subsystem. It also supports automatic saving and restoring of
the mixer state, as well as importing a mixer state file via the content
interface.

## Upstream documentation

Existing documentation from the upstream project can be found on the ALSA
[project homepage](http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page).
